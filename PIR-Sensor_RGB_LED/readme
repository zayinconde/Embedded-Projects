This is a simple project that oscillates between Red green and blue with a delay whenever PIR sensor detects infared radiation movement detected (by a human movement). 

i created a custom function for the RGB so the color values can be changed in the typical RGB format (255,255,255) ->>> (red,green,blue) which allows for all color combinations 
that the LED is capable of. 

The PIR sensor is very simple to use with the complete PCB circuit simplifying things. The board just needs power, ground and provides a digital output. 
In code i just defined the variable as boolean (true or false) for the digital read of the pin connected to the IR sensor. So its a simple "is human present?" True or false answer.

Notably, on the PIR sensor circuit there are 2 pot meters for extra adjustability. The left one is for distance of sensing (sensitivity), the right one is for time delay between detection. 
Sensitivity: From 3 meters to 7 meters
Time Delay: From 5 seconds to 5 minutes.
